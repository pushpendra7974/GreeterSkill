# Greeter Skill
This is my first Alexa Skill developed using Nodejs and Aws Lambda Functions. The code written in this repository is the bare minimum code required to create an Alexa skill.

In order to create your first Alexa skill, you need to follow these steps:

__Prerequisite__
* [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and install Nodejs on your local computer
* If you don't have an account on Amazon then visit [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and signup for free tier. You will get lot of freeware to get started with Amazon Web Services.
* Download this entire repository to your local system.
